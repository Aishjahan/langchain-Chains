🧠 Langchain Chains
===================

This repository showcases various types of **LangChain Chains**, which are powerful tools for structuring and orchestrating multiple steps in an AI-powered workflow. Chains allow you to combine prompts, models, conditionals, and logic into a single, coherent process — perfect for building complex AI applications.

📂 Repository Structure
-----------------------

This repo includes examples of:

*   **Simple Chain** – One input, one output
    
*   **Sequential Chain** – A pipeline of multiple steps
    
*   **Parallel Chain** – Multiple chains running at once
    
*   **Conditional Chain** – Chains selected based on logic
    

💡 Why Chains Matter
--------------------

While single LLM calls are useful, real-world applications often require multiple steps:

*   Generating intermediate data
    
*   Filtering or transforming outputs
    
*   Applying logic to route decisions
    

Chains make this modular, testable, and scalable.

🔄 Types of Chains
------------------

### ✅ Simple Chain

A direct connection between an input and a single model output. Ideal for basic use cases like prompt completion or summarization.

### 🔁 Sequential Chain

Executes tasks step-by-step, where the output of one becomes the input of the next. Commonly used for tasks like:"Summarize → Translate → Format as Email"

### 🧩 Parallel Chain

Runs multiple models or prompts at the same time. Useful when you want to analyze or generate different outputs from the same input simultaneously (e.g., sentiment, keywords, category).

### 🔀 Conditional Chain

Executes different chains based on conditions in the input. Helps implement control flow (like if-else) to route tasks intelligently, such as choosing different responses for resume parsing vs. general queries.
